# Permit to Work (PTW) & LOTO – Field Operator Notes

## Purpose
PTW and LOTO systems are critical for preventing accidents during maintenance
and operational interventions in industrial plants.

## Permit to Work (PTW)
PTW ensures that all tasks are:
- Properly authorized
- Risk assessed
- Communicated to all affected parties

### Common PTW Types
- Cold work permit
- Hot work permit
- Confined space entry

### Field Operator Responsibilities
- Verify permit validity and scope
- Ensure isolation points are clearly identified
- Confirm gas testing where applicable
- Monitor worksite for deviations
- Stop work if unsafe conditions arise

## Lockout Tagout (LOTO)
LOTO prevents accidental energization of equipment.

### Basic LOTO Steps
1. Identify energy sources
2. Isolate equipment
3. Apply lock and tag
4. Release stored energy
5. Verify zero energy state

### Key Awareness
- Never remove another person’s lock
- Always follow plant isolation procedures
- Coordinate with control room before and after isolation
