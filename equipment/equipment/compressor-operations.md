# Compressor Operations – Field Operator Notes

## Purpose
Compressors are critical rotating equipment used to increase gas pressure
for process and utility systems. Safe operation is essential to prevent
equipment damage and safety incidents.

## Common Compressor Types
- Centrifugal compressors
- Reciprocating compressors

## Pre-Start Checks
- Oil level and lubrication system status
- Cooling system availability
- Suction and discharge valves correctly lined up
- No abnormal vibration or noise
- Area cleared and PTW in place

## During Operation
- Monitor vibration levels
- Check bearing and casing temperatures
- Observe suction and discharge pressures
- Listen for abnormal sounds

## Common Abnormal Conditions
- High vibration
- High discharge temperature
- Oil pressure drop
- Surge (for centrifugal compressors)

## Operator Action
- Inform control room immediately
- Reduce load or initiate shutdown if required
- Follow PTW and LOTO before inspection
